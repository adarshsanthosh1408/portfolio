      <p>21 May 1960</p>
      <h4>Born In Pathanamthitta, Kerala</h4>
      <p>Mohanlal was born in Elanthoor, Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, as the son of Mr.Vishwanathan Nair, a lawyer and government employee and Mrs. Santhakumari on 21st May 1960. The family later shifted, to Mudavanmugal in Thiruvananthapuram, which was his maternal house.</p>
      <h4>Lal’s First Tryst With Acting</h4> 
      <p>Mohanlal began his schooling at Mudavanmugal LP School, , from there he moved to Model School, Thiruvananthapuram. It was there, he found a platform for his acting skills. He was chosen as the best actor of the school in the year 1972. He bagged the award by competing with the 10th-grade students, and at that time he himself was in 6th grade. He did his under graduation at Mahatma Gandhi College, Thiruvananthapuram. There he was able to make an association with like-minded fellow students, who were passionate about theater and feature films.</p>
      <h4>Audition & First Time Filming</h4>  
      <p>Mohanlal got his first entry into the film when his friends opened up a film company called Bharath Cine Group. They made a movie ' Thiranottam ', in which Mohanlal was given a comic role to enact. Unfortunately, this film was released just in one theater and was not able to reach a wider audience. His first meaningful breakthrough in movies came only in the 1980s. Apparently, Mohanlal’s friends got him to audition for a production house that was looking for a fresh face and he was able to make it and he was selected by Navodaya Appachen for playing the role of the antagonist in the movie Manjil Virinja Pookkal which turned out to be a major hit.</p>
